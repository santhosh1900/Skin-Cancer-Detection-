### Skin Cancer Detection ###

Skin cancer the most common human malignancy and is primarily diagnosed visually and it involves a sheer amount of time and technicalities.
Deep learning can automate this diagnosis process,thus eliminating human error and saving million of lives.

-Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical diagnosis

-This project is built to detect skin cancer at an early stage using deep convolutional neural networks.

-This model can be used to detect nearly 7 categories of skin cancer:


1. Benign keratosis-like lesions 
2. Melanoma
3. Melanocytic nevi
4. Vascular lesions
5. Dermatofibroma
6. Basal cell carcinoma - most common form of skin-cancer.
7.  Actinic keratoses 

### For this project we used the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset

### And used the EfficientNetB3 Architecture  
      
### Our model was abel to produce an accuracy score over 85%.
